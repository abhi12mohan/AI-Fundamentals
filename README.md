# Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals

## Overview
A collection of different labs completed for my Artificial Intelligence class (6.034). Specifically, I cover representations, methods, and architectures used to build applications, and to account for understanding and developing intelligence from a computational perspective - aka "artificial intelligence" (AI).

## 1. Search
Exploration of different graph search approaches and algorithms.

* Blind Search  
◦&nbsp; Depth-First Search  
◦&nbsp; Breadth-First Search
    
* Heuristic Search  
◦&nbsp; Hill Climbing  
◦&nbsp; Best-First Search  
◦&nbsp; Beam Search   

* Optimal Search  
◦&nbsp; Branch & Bound  
◦&nbsp; Branch & Bound w/ A*  

## 2. Games
Exploration of representing a game as a decision tree and performing search operations on the tree.

* Representation Methods  
◦&nbsp; Game Completion  
◦&nbsp; Move Generation  
◦&nbsp; Determining Heuristics  

* Search Methods  
◦&nbsp; Cooperative Depth-First Search  
◦&nbsp; Ordinary Minimax Search  
◦&nbsp; Minimax Search w/ Alpha-beta Pruning  
◦&nbsp; Progressive Deepening
