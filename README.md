# Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals

## Overview
A collection of different labs completed for my Artificial Intelligence class (6.034). Specifically, I cover representations, methods, and architectures used to build applications, and to account for understanding and developing intelligence from a computational perspective - aka "artificial intelligence" (AI).

## 1. Search
Exploration of different graph search approaches and algorithms, including:

* Blind Search
  * DFS and BFS
    
* Heuristic Search
  * Hill Climbing
  * Best-First Search
  * Beam Search

* Heuristic Search  
   * Hill Climbing
  * Best-First Search
  * Beam Search

* Optimal Search  
  * Branch & Bound
  * Branch & Bound w/ A*
